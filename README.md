🚀 NOYOBTECH
📱 Project Overview

NOYOBTECH is a modern online store for selling high-quality tech gadgets. Users can buy smartphones, laptops, tablets, headphones, and other devices at competitive prices.

This project is created as a portfolio project and is designed to practice RTK Query usage in a real-world app.

🧰 Tech Stack

The project uses a modern frontend stack:

⚛️ React (18+) — UI development

🟦 TypeScript — strict typing and fewer errors

🛒 Redux Toolkit + RTK Query — server state management (caching, refetch, pagination)

🔀 React Router DOM — navigation

🎨 Tailwind CSS / SCSS — fast and responsive styling

⚡ Vite — fast development and optimized builds

🛠 Key Features

🗂 Product catalog with filters (price, brand, category, specs)

📄 Detailed product pages with images, descriptions, and reviews

🛒 Shopping cart with localStorage persistence

✅ Order form with validation

📑 Pagination and Infinite Scroll for product listings

🔄 Data caching using RTK Query

📱 Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop

🔄 API

The project works with a REST API:

📌 Swagger API:
👉 http://37.27.29.18:8002/swagger/index.html

src/api/baseApi.ts


To connect your own backend, just update the baseUrl.
